              Therefore,
              <b>
                privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. 
                Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous 
                transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous 
                system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired 
                and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.

              Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say 
              something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. 
              If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have 
              no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, 
              and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too 
              much desire for privacy. Furthermore,
              <b>
                to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is 
                anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

              We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, 
              faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.

              It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect 
              that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight 
              against the realities of information. Information does not just 
              want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill 
              the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, 
              stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, 
              knows more, and understands less than Rumor.

              We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous 
              transactions to take place. People have been defending their own 
              privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed 
              doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the 
              past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.
