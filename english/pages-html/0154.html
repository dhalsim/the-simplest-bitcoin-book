                Therefore,

                  privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
                  systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An
                  anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction
                  system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal
                  their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the
                  essence of privacy.

                Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say
                something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.
                If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no
                privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and
                to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much
                desire for privacy. Furthermore,
                <b>
                  to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is
                  anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

                We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large,
                faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their
                beneficence.

                It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect
                that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight
                against the realities of information. Information does not just
                want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to
                fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's
                younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has
                more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.

                We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous
                transactions to take place. People have been defending their own
                privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed
                doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the
                past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic
                technologies do.
