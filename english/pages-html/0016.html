            I have never yet had anyone who could, through the use of logic and
            reason, justify the Federal government borrowing the use of its own
            money… I believe the time will come when people will demand that
            this be changed. I believe the time will come in this country when
            they will actually blame you and me and everyone else connected with
            the Congress for sitting idly by and permitting such an idiotic
            system to continue.

            When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our
            account to cover the check, but when the Federal Reserve writes a
            check there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When
            the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money.
