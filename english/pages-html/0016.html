          I have never yet had anyone who could, through the use of logic and
          reason, justify the Federal government borrowing the use of its own
          moneyâ€¦ I believe the time will come when people will demand that this
          be changed. I believe the time will come in this country when they
          will actually blame you and me and everyone else connected with the
          Congress for sitting idly by and permitting such an idiotic system to
          continue.

          When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our
          account to cover the check, but when the Federal Reserve writes a
          check there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When the
          Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money.
