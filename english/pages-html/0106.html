                In 1933
                <b>
                  President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which
                  required every US citizen to turn in most of their gold in
                  exchange for bank notes.

                The gold was valued at $20.67/oz. The following year, the
                government increased the price of gold to $35/oz with the Gold
                Reserve Act of 1934, effectively devaluing the notes people had
                received by almost half, since the value of their notes never
                went up with the inflated gold price.
