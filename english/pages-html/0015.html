          I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.
          A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.

          completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized
          world. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a
          government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a
          government by the opinion and duress of
          a small group of dominant men.
