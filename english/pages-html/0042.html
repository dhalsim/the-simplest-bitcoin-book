              Since the people are mostly in the dark about how war spending
              works, or where the money for war comes from, there is little to
              no accountability on the part of government. Wars can drag on for

              Starting with Vietnam, wars have become 'credit card wars' (h/t

              initial loans... rinse and repeat.
