                Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write
                software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy
                unless we all do, we're going to write it.
              </b>
              We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice
              and play with it.

              Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
              fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact,
              removes information from the public realm. Even laws against
              cryptography reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of
              its violence.
