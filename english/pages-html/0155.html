                  Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write
                  software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy
                  unless we all do, we're going to write it.
                </b>

                We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice
                and play with it.

                We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we
                write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a
                widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

                Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption
                is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact,
                removes information from the public realm. Even laws against
                cryptography reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm
                of its violence.

                Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and

                possible.

                  For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social
                  contract. People must come and together deploy these systems
                  for the common good.
                </b>

                Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows
                in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your
                concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
                ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course
                because some may disagree with our goals.
