          <span class="line inline m-t-10">
            To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,
            we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's
            Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The
            proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such
            as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The
            average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits
            required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
          </span>

          <span class="line inline indent">
            For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by
            incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives
            the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has
            been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot
            be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained
            after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the
            blocks after it.

          <span class="line inline indent">
            Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and
            will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different
            versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive
            one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one
            they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer.
            The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one
            branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
            branch will then switch to the longer one.
