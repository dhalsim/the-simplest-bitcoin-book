            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer
              basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam
              Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The
              proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such
              as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The
              average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits
              required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
            </span>

            <span class="line inline indent">
              For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by
              incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that
              gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort
              has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block
              cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are
              chained after it, the work to change the block would include
              redoing all the blocks after it.

            <span class="line inline indent">
              The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining
              representation in majority decision making. If the majority were
              based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
              able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially
              one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the
              longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort
              invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest
              nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any
              competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have
              to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and
              then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We
              will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching
              up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

            <span class="line inline indent">
              To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest
              in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is
              determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
              blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty
              increases.

              Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and
              will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast
              different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes
              may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the
              first one they received, but save the other branch in case it
              becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work
              is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were
              working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one.
