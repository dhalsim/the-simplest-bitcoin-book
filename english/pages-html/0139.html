              May 22 is known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. This was the
              day that a guy, named Laszlo Hanyecz, announced
              on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0" target="_blank">
                bitcointalk.org
              </a> that he had successfully
              traded 10,000 bitcoin for pizza! Back then that
              was about $40.

              It was a milestone for bitcoin, in that it was the first
              known incident of someone trading bitcoin for a
              good or service. What a long way we have come!
