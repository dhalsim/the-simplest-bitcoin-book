                  It has been estimated that to break the SHA-256 encryption
                  (that bitcoin uses) within 24 hours, a quantum computer would
                  need 13,000,000 physical qubits. At this time, the current
                  qubit record held by Atom Computing in California is 1,180
                  qubits.

                Being open source means anyone can independently review the
                code. If it was closed source, nobody could verify the security.
                I think it's essential for a program of this nature to be open
                source.
