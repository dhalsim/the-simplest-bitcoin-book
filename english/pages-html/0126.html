                The very fact that bitcoin is not physical is one of the biggest
                factors contributing to it's unconfiscatability!

                There have been hacks at exchanges however, so I highly
                recommend moving your bitcoin to your own self-custody wallet as
                soon as possible.

                It has been estimated that to break the SHA-256 encryption (that
                bitcoin uses) within 24 hours, a quantum computer would need
                13,000,000 physical qubits. At this time, the current qubit
                record held by Atom Computing in California is 1,180 qubits.

                It is widely assumed that a quantum-safe encryption method will

              Being open source means anyone can independently review the code.
              If it was closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think
              it's essential for a program of this nature to be open source.
