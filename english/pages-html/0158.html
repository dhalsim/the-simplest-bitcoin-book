              <b>Abstract.</b>

              A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
              online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
              without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures
              provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a
              trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
              We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a
              peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by
              hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work,
              forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the
              proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the
              sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the
              largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is
              controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the
              network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.
              The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are
              broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin
              the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as
              proof of what happened while they were gone.

            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on
              financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process
              electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most
              transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the
              trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not
              really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid
              mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction
              costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting
              off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a
              broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible
              payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of
              reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of
              their customers, hassling them for more information than they
              would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as
              unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided
              in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to
              make payments over a communications channel without a trusted
              party.

            <span class="line inline indent">
              What is needed is an electronic payment system based on
              cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing
              parties to transact directly with each other without the need for
              a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally
              impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and
              routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect
              buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the
              double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp
              server to generate computational proof of the chronological order
              of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes
              collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of
              attacker nodes.
