                Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
                Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one
                doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is
                something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power
                to selectively reveal oneself to the world.

              If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory
              of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory
              of this; how could anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against
              it, but the

                freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an
                open society;
              </b>
              we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak
              together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and
              aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other parties.
              The power of electronic communications has enabled such group
              speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it
              to.

              Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
              transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly
              necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be
              spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In
              most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a
              magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need
              to know who I am.

              When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive
              messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what
              I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need
              know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees.
              When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the
              transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal
              myself; I must always reveal myself.
