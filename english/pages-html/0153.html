                  Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic
                  age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one
                  doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is
                  something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the
                  power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.

                If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a
                memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their
                own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One could pass
                laws against it, but the
                <b>
                  freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to
                  an open society;
                </b>

                we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak
                together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and
                aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other
                parties. The power of electronic communications has enabled such
                group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might
                want it to.

                Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
                transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly
                necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be
                spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.
                In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase
                a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no
                need to know who I am.

                When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive
                messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or
                what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider
                only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe
                them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying
                mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here
                selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.
