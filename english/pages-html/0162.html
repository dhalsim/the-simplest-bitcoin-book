              8. Simplified Payment Verification
            </span>

            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              It is possible to verify payments without running a full network
              node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the
              longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network
              nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain
              the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's
              timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by
              linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node
              has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the
              network has accepted it.

            <span class="line inline indent">
              As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes
              control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is
              overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
              transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled
              by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the
              attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
              protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes
              when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software
              to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the
              inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will
              probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent
              security and quicker verification.

            <span class="line inline b">9. Combining and Splitting Value</span>

            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it
              would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in
              a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions
              contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either
              a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple
              inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for
              the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the
              sender.

            </div>

            <span class="line inline indent m-t-10">
              It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on
              several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more,
              is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a
              complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.
