                Over time, when the world is hyperbitcoinized, meaning we are living on a bitcoin standard, those that
                have more will naturally spend it into the economy.

                Even though at a certain point one will no longer be
                able to buy it with fiat, people will get paid for their
                work in bitcoin. Being paid in truly sound money will
                allow us to have real savings that will not be debased

                and those with less, due to a vast number of factors,

                Having been born into, and swimming our whole lives
                in a fiat world, it is almost impossible to imagine, and
