                    In releasing the protocol openly, Satoshi allowed it to roam
                    freely, and those that understood the potential it held
                    either mined, or bought in early. It was the fairest and
                    most organic way possible to present it to the world.

                  Over time, when the world is hyperbitcoinized, meaning we are
                  living on a bitcoin standard, those that have more will
                  naturally spend it into the economy.

                  bitcoin. Being paid in truly sound money will allow us to have
