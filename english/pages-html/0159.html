            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.
              Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a
              hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next
              owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify
              the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

              The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the
              owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to
              introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every
              transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin
              must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins
              issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
              The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire
              money system depends on the company running the mint, with every
              transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.

            <span class="line inline indent">
              We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did
              not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest
              transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later
              attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a
              transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based
              model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which
              arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party,
              transactions must be publicly announced [1], and we need a system
              for participants to agree on a single history of the order in
              which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time
              of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first
              received.

            <span class="line inline b">3. Timestamp Server</span>

            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A
              timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be
              timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper
              or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have
              existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash.
              Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash,
              forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the
              ones before it.
