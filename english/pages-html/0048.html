              If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU proof-of-worker than all the
              honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by
              stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.
              He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour
              him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and
              the validity of his own wealth."
