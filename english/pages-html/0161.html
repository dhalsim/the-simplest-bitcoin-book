              New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all
              nodes. As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a
              block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped
              messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it
              when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.

            <span class="line inline b">6. Incentive</span>

            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special
              transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the
              block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network,
              and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation,
              since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady
              addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold
              miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our
              case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
            </span>

            <span class="line inline indent">
              The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the
              output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the
              difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive
              value of the block containing the transaction. Once a
              predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the
              incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be
              completely inflation free.
            </span>

            <span class="line inline indent">
              The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy
              attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest
              nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people
              by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.
              He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such
              rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else
              combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own
              wealth.

            <span class="line inline b">7. Reclaiming Disk Space</span>

            <span class="line inline m-t-10">
              Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough
              blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save
              disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
              transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the
              root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be
              compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior
              hashes do not need to be stored.

              A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we
              suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 *
              365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with
              2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth
              of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the
              block headers must be kept in memory
