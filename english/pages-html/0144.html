            <b>Be warned:</b>
            It helps to have a somewhat thick skin on twitter, and know this,
            there is a lot of passion in defense of bitcoin. Keeping a clear
            line between it and all the altcoins takes work. Maintaining the
            clarity, security and purity of the only truly sound money the world
            has ever known is critical, if we are to have a chance in these
            times a'coming.
