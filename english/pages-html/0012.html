            <b>Scott Pelley of NBC '60 Minutes':</b>
            Fair to say you simply flooded the system with money?
            <br />
            <b>Fed Chair Jerome Powell:</b>
            Yes. We did. That's another way to think about it. We did.
            <br />
            <b>Pelley:</b>
            Where does it come from? Do you just print it?
            <br />
            <b>Powell:</b>
            We print it digitally. So as a central bank, we have the ability to
            create money digitally. And we do that by buying Treasury Bills or
            bonds for other government guaranteed securities. And that actually
            increases the money supply. We also print actual currency and we
            distribute that through the Federal Reserve banks.
