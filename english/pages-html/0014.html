            Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute
            master of all industry and commerce… when you realize that the
            entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a
            few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how
            periods of inflation and depression originate.

            I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator.
            Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and
            effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular
            group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would
            have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.

            This (Federal Reserve) Act, is the most powerful single piece of
            legislation ever enacted in the history of the world. When President
            Woodrow Wilson signed it, the invisible hand of the Federal Reserve
            System was born.
