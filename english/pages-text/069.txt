H: What is [b]Bitcoin?

[o:20]r: SATOSHI’s GENIUS

[obb:

[b] Bitcoin is *ALL* of the following:

  [m-l-20
    -> A *decentralized, distributed ledger*
    -> A *payment system*
    -> *And the value **itself** being transferred.*
  ]

]

[b] Outside of bitcoin, *money creation* (issuance), and
*accounting* (keeping track of money received/spent),
*is centralized*, and includes the following separate
layers:

[m-l-20:
  -> Various *Central Banks' issuance* of money
  -> *The ledgers of account*, whether written or digital
  -> *The trusted parties* who enter the numbers into
the ledgers
  -> *The trusted parties* who keep the physical ledgers
safe, or who maintain the computer databases
  -> *The trusted security teams* who work to prevent
hacking of the databases
]

[b] With bitcoin, *all these layers are folded into one!*

[b] While this might sound more centralized, Satoshi’s
genius made it such that the opposite is true.

[b] It is *100% Decentralized!*
