H: HOW DOES [O]NOSTR WORK?

ri> Anyone can run a relay. A relay is very simple and
dumb. It does nothing besides accepting posts
from some people and forwarding to others.
Relays donâ€™t have to be trusted.
Signatures are verified on the client side.

[O] When you open your nostr client, you will see all the
notes posted by you and those you follow in
chronological order.

[O] There are *no algorithms* deciding what to show you,
what to withhold from you, or censoring your posts.

[O] Like Bitcoin, nostr uses public/private key pairs.

[
  -> *PUBLIC KEY* = npub, like a username
  -> *PRIVATE KEY* = nsec, like a password
]

[pbb:
  [O] *NOTE:* Your private key cannot be reset if
      lost, so you *must secure it well!*
  [O] If you leak your private key, whoever has
      access to it has access to your nostr
      account, and *there is no way to regain
      sole access.*
