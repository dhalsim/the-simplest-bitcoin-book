[p:18]r: WHY THE OSTRICH?

  *The Nostrich Origin Story*
  by Walker@primal.net

  *December 16, 2022:*
  I discovered ChatGPT3 and,
  naturally, asked it
  “Can you write a joke about #nostr?”
  ChatGPT3 responded:
  Q: What do you call a nosy ostrich?
  A: A nosTrich!
  The joke wasn’t great, but you can’t blame a bot. Regardless, I
  loved the idea of a visual identity for nostr, and ostriches are
  cool birds. So I took to Midjourney and created The #Nostrich

*December 20, 2022:*
@jb55 proposed the “Nostrich” as the official Nostr mascot
and logo.
Three minutes later, @jack tweets the Nostrich image.
The rest, as they say, is history.
