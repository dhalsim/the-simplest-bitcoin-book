[o] WE NEED [b]bitcoin
TO SAVE THE GARDEN

[b] *Bitcoin plucks out, at the root, THE biggest issue we
face, the Fiat Lie.*

[b] This is the lie of corrupted fiat currency, usury and all
that comes with it to steal your time, while greatly
enriching those closest to the money printer.

[b] The *Fiat Lie* is like a giant *monster weed* in your garden, *sucking* all the nutrients from the soil, *killing*
all the mycelium, and *blocking* the sunlight so that
the other plants cannot thrive, and are struggling to
survive.

[b] Suddenly when this noxious, monster Fiat Lie weed
is gone, Truth enters!

[obb:

[b] All the plants (*the people*) can begin to recover.

[b] The soil (being peoples’ creativity, real goods and
services) can regenerate.

[b] The mycelium (*being authentic connection between
people*) will regrow.

[b] And the sunlight (*unmediated life force*) will shine
down once again upon us all!
