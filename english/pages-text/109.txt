H: Dispelling [b]bitcoin FUD

[b]b: ‘Too much’ energy is a value proposition that must
consider how we value the purpose of the energy
use.

[b] *When one considers that the Christmas lights in the US use as much electricity as the entire Bitcoin network,* then perhaps one can see that it is all relative!

[b] Using energy, even a whole lot of energy, to secure
the hardest, most censorship-resistant money
humanity has ever known, is more than worth it.

[b] In comparing bitcoin energy usage to that used by
the legacy system, we also need to consider the ‘full
stack’ on both sides:

| Bitcoin Ecosystem    | Legacy Fiat System 
| ---------------------| ------------------ 
| ASIC Miners          | BIS                
| Nodes                | Central Banks      
| Hardware Wallets     | National/Regional Banks     
| Software Wallet Apps | Military Industrial Complex 
                         Backup Data Centers
                         Physical Money Printing
                         Physical Money Distribution
                         Online Banking Apps
                         Network of ATMs

[b] By using bitcoin, we will ultimately reduce energy
usage in a multitude of other areas, most notably
by no longer needing the Military Industrial
Complex to protect the petro dollar.
