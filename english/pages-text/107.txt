rmi> The possibility to be anonymous or
pseudonymous relies on you not revealing
any identifying information about
yourself in connection with the bitcoin
addresses you use. If you post your
bitcoin address on the web, then you’re
associating that address and any
transactions with it with the name you
posted under.
If you posted under a handle that
you haven’t associated with your real
identity, then you’re still pseudonymous.

rmi> For greater privacy, it’s best to use
bitcoin addresses only once. You can
change addresses as often as you want.
