H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[b] *Bitcoin is scarce.*
[b] It has a hard cap of 21,000,000.
[b] There will never be more.
[b] Code is law here.*

* While it is ‘technically’ possible to change the
code, Satoshi’s genius prevents that, since increasing
(inflating) the supply would only serve to decrease the
value of all bitcoin in circulation. This therefore
incentivizes everyone to implicitly agree to maintain
the 21,000,000 hard cap supply.

the current block height, the available supply, and
numerous other metrics with regard to the bitcoin
timechain.
