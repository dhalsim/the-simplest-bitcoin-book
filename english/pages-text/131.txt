[o:18]r: BITCOIN PIZZA DAY

[b] May 22 is known as Bitcoin Pizza Day. This was the
day that a guy, named Laszlo Hanyecz, announced
on bitcointalkforum.org that he had successfully
traded 10,000 bitcoin for pizza! Back then that
was about $40.

[b] In today’s prices, that would be ~$610,000,000. 

[b] It was a milestone for bitcoin, in that it was the first
known incident of someone trading bitcoin for a
good or service. What a long way we have come!
