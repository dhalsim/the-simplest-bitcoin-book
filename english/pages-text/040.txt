H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[b] *Bitcoin is the great incentivizer.*

[obb] [b] *The genius of Satoshi was such that in bitcoin, for
the first time, both good and bad actors are incentivized to play by the rules.*

ri> “The incentive may help encourage
nodes to stay honest.
If a greedy attacker is able to assemble
more CPU proof-of-worker than all the
honest nodes, he would have to choose
between using it to defraud people by
stealing back his payments,
or using it to generate new coins.
He ought to find it more profitable to play
by the rules, such rules that favour
him with more new coins than
everyone else combined,
than to undermine the system and
the validity of his own wealth.”
