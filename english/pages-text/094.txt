H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:20]r: ACQUIRING BITCOIN

[b] *Bitcoin enters the market by miners selling some of
the bitcoins they receive as rewards,* in order to pay
for their operating costs.

[b] *You can acquire bitcoin by buying on a peer-to-peer
trading platform, by accepting it as payment for
goods or services you offer, as a gift, or by mining
it.* (A very last resort, not recommended, is to buy it
from a registered exchange).

[b] When you receive it, you are technically receiving the
private keys with which to access your bitcoin.

[obb][b] *Remember:* The bitcoin itself never leaves the
                     timechain.

[b] You can acquire bitcoin either anonymously, or
with ID verification (KYC - Know Your Customer)

[b] KYC is required by law to fulfill AML (anti-money laundering laws) 
when buying from exchanges.

[obb][b] Buying non-KYC bitcoin *preserves your right to
privacy in the future.*
