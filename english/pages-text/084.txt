H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

--o--
[b] *PUBLIC KEY ~ Like a bank account number for
receiving bitcoin.*
--o--

[m-l-20] -> You can give it to people to send you bitcoin,
just like you would give your account number to
someone so they can send you fiat.

--o--
[b] *PRIVATE KEY ~ For securing, accessing and sending bitcoin, like the key to a safety deposit box.*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> A bitcoin private key is a secret string of numbers
and letters that allows you to send/spend your
bitcoin.
-> Only you have a copy. **It is very important to
keep it very safe and secure, as anyone who
obtains a copy can spend your bitcoin.**

]

--o--
[b] *DISTRIBUTED LEDGER ~ A ledger maintained by
everyone who wishes to help maintain it.*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> Instead of a centrally-controlled ledger that is
invisible to the public, like one that a bank maintains, Bitcoin is a transparent, open, decentralized
ledger visible to anyone, anytime.
-> The addresses are strings of letters and numbers,
with no names attached.
-> While pseudonymous, it is possible to track transactions, especially if the bitcoin was bought from
a centralized KYC exchange.
-> The Bitcoin network is trustless and anyone can
audit it anytime, unlike a bank where one must
trust that the ledgers are being kept honestly.
