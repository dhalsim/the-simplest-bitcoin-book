H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:20]r: ON PRIVACY

[b] Privacy when *buying (non-KYC), securing, storing
and spending* bitcoin is becoming more and more
important, especially in light of recent events with
bank accounts being seized/frozen.

[obb][b] In addition, *general digital privacy is critical if you
wish to gain online sovereignty, and protect yourself from undue surveillance and fraud.*

[b] Below are some current privacy-focused services.

[b] It is beyond the scope of this book to go deeply into
each of the following, so absolutely DYOR, and
follow the accounts I mention below on Nostr or
Twitter for updates.

r> Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic
age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something
one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret
matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know.
Privacy is the power to selectively reveal
oneself to the world.

~Eric Hughes, From ‘A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto’
