H: How To [b]bitcoin

[b] Have them walk you through sending your bitcoin
from your account with them to your own wallet, so
that you are self-custodying your bitcoin
*= Holding your own keys.*

[obb:

-> *Note:* This does NOT erase the fact you
bought bitcoin from them.
-> b: Transactions are traceable on-chain, and in
many countries you are liable for taxation when
spending your bitcoin.

[b] If you want to buy through Venmo or Paypal, be
sure to *first confirm that you can still withdraw
your sats to your own self-hosted wallet.* In the
past you could not do so.

[b] As they say:

r> *“No keys, No cheese”* or
r> *“Not your keys, Not your bitcoin”*

[b] What this means is, so long as a centralized service is
holding the private keys to your bitcoin, there remains
the possibility that their platform gets hacked, or that
they undergo regulatory capture and you lose your
bitcoin.

[obb][b]b: Always withdraw your bitcoin to your own
self-hosted wallet as soon as you have
bought it.
