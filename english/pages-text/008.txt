> If there were no debts in our money system,
there wouldn’t be any money

~ Marriner Eccles,
1941, Gov. of the Fed

> I have never yet had anyone who could, through the
use of logic and reason, justify the Federal government
borrowing the use of its own money…
I believe the time will come when people will
demand that this be changed.
I believe the time will come in this country when
they will actually blame you and me and
everyone else connected with the Congress
for sitting idly by and permitting
such an idiotic system to continue.

~ Wright Patman
US Congressman 1928-1976
Chairman, Committee on Banking and Currency 1963-1975

> When you or I write a check, there must be sufficient funds in our
account to cover the check, but when the Federal Reserve writes a
check there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn. When
the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money.

~ Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
'Putting It Simply', 1984
