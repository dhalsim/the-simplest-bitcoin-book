H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[p:18]r: HOW DOES [O]NOSTR WORK?

[O] *Nostr has two parts:* Clients and Relays.

[O] *A CLIENT is an INTERFACE* (app or website) that is run
on the nostr protocol. 

[O] *It is where you see the notes* that you and the people
you follow post (in the same way that twitter is an
interface where you post and read notes by others,
except twitter is centralized & it censors posts.)

[O] *A RELAY is a SERVER and a DATABASE.* Anyone can
run a relay, which is what makes nostr decentralized.

[O] *It is where your notes are sent, stored and retrieved
from* by clients.

[O] There are many relays and you can choose which ones
to connect to. Some are free and some are paid.

[O] When you post a message, it is broadcast to the relays
you are connected to.

[O] The clients query the relays they are connected to, and
then they populate the messages being hosted by
those relays.
