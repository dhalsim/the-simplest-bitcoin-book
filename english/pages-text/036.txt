[o:20] WHAT IS [b]bitcoin?

ri> “Writing a description for this thing
for general audiences is bloody hard.
There’s nothing to relate it to.”

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-07-05

ri> Total circulation will be 21,000,000
coins. It’ll be distributed to network
nodes (miners) when they make blocks,
with the amount cut in half every 4 years.
first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins etc...
When that runs out, the system can support
transaction fees if needed. It’s based on
open market competition, and there will
probably always be nodes willing to
process transactions for free.

the potential to free us all from the overarching
manipulation by, and control of, the central banking
system.

[b] *In bitcoin, the monetary rules are the same for
EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE.*

[b] Bitcoin is *inclusive*, in the sense that anyone with an
internet connection can participate in the network,
and *has to play by the same rules.*
