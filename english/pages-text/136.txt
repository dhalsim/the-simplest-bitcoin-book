H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[r:
  [o:18] BT ~ BITCOIN TWITTER

  Some cypherpunks, geniuses, goats & wild ones to follow!
  Through these accounts, you will find 1000's of plebs
  and other deep thinkers,
  all on the journey.
  BT, along with bitcointalk.org and Reddit, has largely been
  where this experiment has grown,
  and now joined by Nostr,
  the decentralized communication protocol,
  all unfurling in real time, across time and space,
  in the ethers of cyberspace, connected to the physical,
  through all of us,
  humans,
  sharing a vision of a decentralized world.
  Then there are the quieter ones, developers working
  behind the scenes
  without whom
  none of this would be possible.
  All of us
  together,
  unleashed,
  as bitcoin was unleashed upon us,
  a blessing beyond measure.

*Be warned:* It helps to have a somewhat thick skin on twitter,
and know this, there is a lot of passion in defense of
bitcoin. Keeping a clear line between it and all the
altcoins takes work. Maintaining the clarity, security and
purity of the only truly sound money the world has ever
known is critical, if we are to have a chance in these times
a’coming.
