Profound gratitude to Satoshi, Fiatjaf, the cypherpunks
past, present and future, Nostr fam, the BT vortex, the
toxic maxis, the non-toxic maxis, the meme-lords and -
ladies, the believers, the cynics, the seers...
and always,
my beloved family, friends,
and the One who breathes through us all,
for always seeing me through,
more precious than anything, even bitcoin
