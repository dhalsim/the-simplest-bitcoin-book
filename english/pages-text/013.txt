[o] ON QE (QUANTITATIVE EASING)

[b] *Quantitative Easing is considered an ‘unconventional
monetary policy’ used by Central Banks to ‘stimulate
the economy’, whereby the Fed buys government
bonds and other government securities.*

[b] It was first used by Japan between 2001-2006. Following that, the US, UK, and the Eurozone used
QE during the 2008 financial crisis

[b] Since then, the only time the US has not had a QE
program was between 2014-2019.

[b] As seen below, critics contend that *QE
overwhelmingly benefits the already-wealthy.*
