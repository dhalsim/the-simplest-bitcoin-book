[m-l-20:
  -> Old investors are not paid any money by new investors.
  -> When buying bitcoin, no one is promising a return
  on your investment.
  -> There is no leadership or promotions team.
  -> There was no pre-mine.
  -> *Read:* ‘Why Bitcoin is Not a Ponzi’ by Lyn Alden

[o:18]r: BITCOIN IS TOO SLOW

[b] While the Bitcoin base layer is slow, the 2nd layer
*Lightning Network built on the base layer is …
lightning fast!*

[b] Bitcoin’s network can process about 7
transactions per second (TPS).

[b] The Visa network claims it can process up to 24,000
TPS, although 4,000 TPS is closer to actual usage.

[b]b: The Lightning Network, a second layer solution
built on Bitcoin, has the potential capacity to
process millions of transactions per second!
