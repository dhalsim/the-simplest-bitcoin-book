*Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one
doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter
is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is
the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.*

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has
a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about
their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One
could pass laws against it, but the *freedom of speech, even
more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society;* we
seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak
together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others
and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and
other parties. The power of electronic communications has
enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely
because we might want it to.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to
a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly
necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be
spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.
In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase
a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no
need to know who I am.

When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive
messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or
what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my
provider only need know how to get the message there and
how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed
by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no
privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always
reveal myself.
