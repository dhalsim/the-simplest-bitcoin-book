[o:18]ENVIRONMENT

[b] Sound money with a hard-capped supply creates a
very different dynamic to the one created by the
debt-based, unlimited money-printing which we
see taking place today.

[b] Instead of an unstoppable drive to consume ever
more, in a race to the bottom to pay
compounding interest rates on loans and debt
that will ultimately never get paid off, *bitcoin
provides an off-ramp to a world where a low-time
preference is sought after.*

[o][b] Rampant environmental destruction is *replaced
with less consumption, less waste, and a
considered approach to production,* where the
market decides what holds true value, and
things are therefore built to last.

[b] This is a net benefit to people, plants and animals!
