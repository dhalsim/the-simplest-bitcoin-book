H: Dispelling [b]Bitcoin FUD

[o:18]r: BITCOIN IS TOO VOLATILE

[b] *This is normal during the price discovery phase of
a new monetary asset.* There is no other way for
growth to happen when it is organic and emergent
(as opposed to top down and centrally controlled.

[b] In addition, at this stage of human existence, with
exponential shifts happening in all spheres, it makes
sense that something as rEVOLutionary as bitcoin will
have wild swings.

[b] While those of us deep down the rabbit hole see it
as the future, currently only a small percent of the
global population holds bitcoin at this time. This
makes it vulnerable to immense volatility.

[b] As it matures, and adoption increases, the volatility will decrease, and eventually it will stabilize and
become a unit of account.

rmi> Iâ€™m sure that in 20 years there will
either be very large transaction
volume or no volume.
