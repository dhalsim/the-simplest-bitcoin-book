WE NEED [b]itcoin

TO HELP PEOPLE ESCAPE TYRANNY
AND CURRENCY COLLAPSE

[b] As we have seen, over the past couple of years,
governments can and do freeze the bank
accounts of those they disagree with.

[obb][b] *This shows that, in essence, your money in the bank
is nothing more than an IOU that can be stolen
from you at any time.*

[b] In addition, when inflation runs rampant, as we are
currently seeing in 2024 in Venezuela (283%), Sudan
(63%), Lebanon (212%), Syria (79%),
Argentina (161%), Zimbabwe (47%), Turkey
(64%) and more, peopleâ€™s life-savings are
vaporized, sometimes overnight, and there is
nothing they can do about it.

[b] For people experiencing any of the above, *bitcoin
becomes a real, immediate solution to
an otherwise untenable problem.*

[b] *Considering that both tyranny and inflation is
on the rise in many places, one would be wise
to hedge against them by acquiring bitcoin now.*
