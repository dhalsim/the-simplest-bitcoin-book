H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[b] Bitcoin is a timechain, literally.

[b] Satoshi referred to the timechain many times in
his emails with the early devs.

[b] You can measure time in blocks, since one block
is mined every ~10 minutes.

[obb:

[b] *Our time is our most scarce and precious resource.*

[b] *It is our literal life force.*

[b] *True Money allows us to store our time.*

]

[b] It is the way we can acknowledge the time we ‘spent’.

[b] We *trade our time for money, which is simply a record
of our time and effort.*

[b] *Bitcoin makes it possible to preserve our time such
that we have ‘access’ to it later in life, when
we are no longer able to work as we once did.*
