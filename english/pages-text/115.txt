[o:18]r: BITCOIN HAS NO REAL VALUE

ri> “Bitcoin's value is driven by its enforceable scarcity”

~ Fidelity Digital Assets

[b]b: Rarity is the value. All money over all time has been
valued because it had some measure of scarcity.

[b] In addition, it was backed by the belief that it would
hold its value, such that it could be traded in the
future for something else of value.

[b] As the Bitcoin network grows, backed by the superior
monetary properties it embodies, the network effect
grows exponentially.

[b] The larger the network effect, the more value it, as a
scarce asset, offers. Value is a reflection of demand,
and as demand increases, value increases.
