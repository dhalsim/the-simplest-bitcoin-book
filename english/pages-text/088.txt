H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o: 25]r: A WORD ON THE
LIGHTNING NETWORK

[b] *Bitcoin blocks are intentionally small** (1MB each),
resulting in the bitcoin mainchain being able to process about 7 transactions per second (TPS).

[b] Visa processes about 24,000 TPS.

[b] Also, *it generally takes about 10 minutes for the
first confirmation to go through on a mainchain
transaction* (since a block is mined on
average every ~10 minutes).

[b] This is not practical if you are at a store and want to
make a quick payment for your goods.

[obb] <b>* Important Detail:</b> The reason the blocks are small,
is to keep *the timechain small enough for anyone to
run their own node at home, which helps keep the
network decentralized.* Satoshi realized the
importance of this ↓

rmi> Bitcoin users might get increasingly
tyrannical about limiting the size of
the chain so it’s easy for lots of users
and small devices.
