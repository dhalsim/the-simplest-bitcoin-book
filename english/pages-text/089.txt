H: A Word On The Lightning Network

[obb:

[b] Enter, *the Lightning Network (LN)*, a *Layer 2 bitcoin
scaling solution.*

[b] ‘Layer 2’ means *it is built on top of bitcoin.*

[b] *‘Scaling Solution’* means it allows the network to:

  [m-l-20:b:

  -> Vastly increase the speed of processing.
  -> Vastly increase the number of transactions it
  can process per second.
  -> Make micropayments possible.

]

[b] The Lightning Network can be (sort of) thought of like
a tab you might keep with some friends at the bar.

[b] You keep track between all of you who owes what
(like a Lightning Network channel), and at the end
of the night your group settles with the barman
(‘the mainchain’).

[b]b: Lightning channels, however, can stay open for
days, weeks, months or years before being
‘settled’ on the mainchain.
