H: WHY WE NEED [O]NOSTR

[p:18]r: WHY WE NEED [O]NOSTR?

We need nostr because the current communication
systems and social media platforms are centralized.

*This is problematic because these systems:*

[O] Have the power to censor your speech.

[O] Are vulnerable to regulatory attacks by the state.

[O] Can choose, or be told, to suspend or delete your
account.

[O] Can be hacked, and thus compromise your data.

[O] Use algorithms to feed you the information they want
you to see.

[O] Manipulate every aspect of your experience on them.

[O] Track all your activity.

[O] Harvest and sell your data.

[O] Use your data to litter your feed with advertisements.
