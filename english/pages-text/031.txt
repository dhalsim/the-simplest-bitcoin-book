WE NEED [b]bitcoin
TO FIX THE WORLD

[b] This is not a joke. *#bitcoinfixesthis* is a running meme
for good reason.

[b] While this might sound somewhat ‘grandiose’, let me
explain. When one considers the ‘way things are’,
*one can see that ‘something is very wrong’.*

[b] Rampant destruction, environmental degradation,
splintered families and communities, loss of cultures, languages, traditions, poverty increasing, massive wealth concentrating in the hands of the (very)
few, over-consumption, infinite money backing
politicians, lack of food and clean water for millions,
ever-increasing obesity and auto-immune disorders,
seemingly endless wars…

[b] One would think that with the exponential growth in
NGOs, non-profit organizations, charitable foundations and so-called government-backed institutions,
these issues would be getting less severe.

[b] Instead, *they are largely becoming more severe.*
