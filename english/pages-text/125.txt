H: Why [b]bitcoin Only?

[b] This in turn has the effect of pumping the price
even further.

[b] *Dump:* This sad part usually happens fast. At a certain
point, the paid group leaders sell their tokens, ‘at the
top’. Then they tell their followers to sell.

[b] *Price Drop:* Because so many people sell at the
same time, and liquidity is generally low since it is
a new coin, the price drops fast.

[b] *Panic:* The price drop causes panic amidst the general
public, who have no idea of these back-door shenanigans, and they start to panic-sell.

[b] *Bag Holders:* The end of this sad story is that those
left ‘holding the bag’, will likely be holding their bags
forever.

[b] Without any real value or fundamentals, most of these
tokens and meme coins never recover a market
price.
