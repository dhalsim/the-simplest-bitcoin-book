H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: SATOSHI’S BIRTHDAY

[b] *<i>April 5, 1975</i>* is the date Satoshi claimed as his
birthday.

[b] While we cannot know if this was indeed his true birth
date, it is very interesting.

[b] *April 5th* (1933) was the day that Executive Order 6102
was signed by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt
“forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion,
and gold certificates within the continental United
States.”

[b] *1975* was the year the repeal of EO 6102 went into
effect, and US citizens were once again allowed to
hold more than 5oz of gold.

[o:18]r: A NUMERIC PALINDROME 6102-2016

[b] *6102* was the number of the above-mentioned
Executive Order.

[b] *2016* is the number of blocks mined during each difficulty adjustment (approximately 2 weeks).

[obb:
  -> In both of the above examples, one could
  postulate that Satoshi was using numbers
  to indicate a reversal, *an unwinding of the
  damage inflicted by government overreach.*
