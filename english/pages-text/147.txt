H: A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto

*Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to
write software to defend privacy, and since we can’t get
privacy unless we all do, we’re going to write it.* We
publish
our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and
play with it.

*Our code is free for all to use, worldwide.* We don’t much
care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We
know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely
dispersed system can’t be shut down.

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for
encryption is fundamentally a private act. The act of
encryp-tion, in fact, removes information from the public
realm. Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a
nation’s bor-der and the arm of its violence.

Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe,
and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it
makes possible.

*For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social
con-tract. People must come and together deploy these
systems for the common good.* Privacy only extends so
far as the cooperation of one’s fellows in society. We the
Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and
hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our
course because some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.
