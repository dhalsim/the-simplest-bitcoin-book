computers all over the world, called ASIC miners
- Application Specific Integrated Circuit miners.

[b] *Miners devote computing power AKA hashrate,
via electricity to the network,* to add blocks to the
Bitcoin blockchain.

[b] These computers run 24 hours a day, usually in sets
of a few, to a few hundred or thousand.

[b] *They are basically running a lottery. When one of
them guesses a number* (the nonce) that generates a
hash that satisfies the current difficulty target, *they
get to add the next block to the timechain.*

[b] *All the above is the proof-of-work (PoW) needed to
birth new bitcoins.*
