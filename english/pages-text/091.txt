H: A Word On The Lightning Network

rmi> Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every
single financial transaction in the
world be broadcast to everyone and
included in the blockchain.
There needs to be a secondary level of
payment systems which is lighter
weight and more efficient.

~ Hal Finney, 2010-12-30, Early cypherpunk
& the second person to run Bitcoin

[b] Bitcoin: *Savings Account* ~ Slower transactions for
                                 larger amounts. 

[b] Lightning: *Checking Account* ~ Faster transactions for
                                    smaller amounts.

rbi> Bitcoin enhanced by Lightning can be viewed as both a
product (digital property) and a service (open monetary
network). The ability to transfer monetary energy through
time and space without government intervention or
conventional banking is enormously valuable to humanity.

~ Michael Saylor, CEO
Microstrategy
