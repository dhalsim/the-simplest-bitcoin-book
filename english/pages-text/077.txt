H: How Does [b]Bitcoin Work?

[o:20] A BITCOIN TRANSACTION:

Ali wants to send Benji some bitcoin:

[obb:

1. Ali *opens the bitcoin wallet* app on her phone and
*clicks ‘Send’.*

2. Benji *opens his wallet app* and *clicks ‘Receive’.*

3. *If they are together:* Ali scans the QR code on the
wallet app on Benji’s phone.

4. *If they are not together:* Ali copies and pastes the
address Benji texts her, into the address field in her
wallet.

5. Ali *enters the amount to send,* and hits *‘Send’.*

6. *A few seconds later,* Benji will see the amount
pending in his wallet.

7. *If it was sent through Lightning* it will be confirmed
almost instantly, and is almost free.

8. *If it was sent ‘onchain’* (on the Bitcoin mainchain),
it includes a small fee, and usually takes around 10
minutes to be confirmed. It can take longer,
depending on network traffic.
