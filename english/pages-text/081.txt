H: How Does [b]Bitcoin Work?

--o--
[b] *MINER ~ A specialized node that both confirms
transactions and issues new bitcoins.*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> Bitcoin miners are specialized computers. They
direct lots of computing power (hashrate) in a
digital lottery to guess a number that will satisfy
the current difficulty algorithm, thereby ‘mining’
a ‘block’ (a piece of the ledger).
-> A mined block is timestamped and added to the
blockchain (aka timechain).

--o--
[b] *DIFFICULTY ALGORITHM ~ A special, adaptive
design that helps keep new bitcoin issuance
predictable.*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> This was one of Satoshi’s genius solutions to help
protect the bitcoin issuance from outrunning itself,
as more advanced computers are developed.
-> When more miners come online, the target number (nonce) in the ‘lottery’ gets smaller, and therefore more difficult to find.
-> When less miners are online, it gets easier.
-> The algorithm *adjusts automatically every 2016
blocks* (about every two weeks), to ensure a predictable rate of supply, where one block is mined
on average every ten minutes.

]

--o--
[b] *NONCE ~ A 32-bit random number*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> A 32-bit random number that miners add to the
end of the hashed list of transactions, to attempt
to satisfy the difficulty target to mine a block.
-> When a miner finds a nonce that leads to
generating a hash below the current target
number, they have mined a block and get to add
it to the blockchain and claim the bitcoin block
reward.
