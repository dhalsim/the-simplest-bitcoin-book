ri> One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of
    speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an
    open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.

~ Eric Hughes, The Cypherpunk's manifesto, 1993

[p:18]r: WHAT IS [Ostrich] NOSTR?

ri> TL;DR: nostr is a protocol that has the power to
    replace twitter, Telegram, and other things.

~ @dergigi 

ri> nostr is to freedom of communication
    as bitcoin is to freedom of transaction.

~ Keysa @SimplestBitcoinBook 

[O] Nostr is a *simple, decentralized protocol for
censorship-resistant, global, interoperable networks.*

[O] Nostr does not rely on a trusted central server.

[O] It is a free and open source (FOSS) software protocol,
like Bitcoin, HTTP or TCP-IP, which allows anyone to
build on nostr.

[O] *It is how we retain our freedom to communicate*
with anyone, anywhere with an internet connection.

ri> (it is) a communications protocol with a
self-sovereign identity layer...
and nostr is also more than that.
