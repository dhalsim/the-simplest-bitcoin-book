[b] This time-theft and tax has affected all other
countries’ fiat currencies as well, since they have all
been pegged to the US dollar, as it has been the
world reserve currency since the Bretton Woods
agreement in 1944.

[b] *In the USA, a 2% annual inflation rate is written into
the Federal Reserve mandate.*

[b] This means that *you are GUARANTEED to be able
to buy 2% LESS with the same $20 bill each year.*

[b] *In March 2024, the annual inflation rate was 3.5%,* 
a lot more than 2%, which means you lost 3.5% of
your purchasing power between March 2023 and
March 2024.

[b] Put another way, this means that on average, things
went up in price by 3.5%.

[b] *If inflation was measured accurately, like it was
done until the early 1980’s, it would actually
be closer to 10% in 2024.*

[b] When looked at by category, one sees that
inflation is a whole lot worse than 3.5% in many
categories over the past year.

[b] When one looks at one's rent, grocery bills, gas
prices, almost anything one buys, it is quite clear that
inflation is rampant in every sector.
