[o:25][b]bitcoin FIXES THIS

[o:20]WAR

[b] The unlimited printing of the fiat monetary
system is what makes ‘forever-wars’ possible and
profitable. 

[b] Since the people are mostly in the dark about how
war spending works, or where the money for war
comes from, there is little to no accountability on
the part of government. Wars can drag on for
years in remote places, with no real oversight.

[b] Starting with Vietnam, wars have become ‘credit
card wars’ (h/t @AlexGladstein), since the
government borrows money to fund the wars, and
then borrows more money to pay the interest on
the initial loans... rinse and repeat.

[obb][b] *On a bitcoin standard, it would require the
people of a country to be willing to help pay for
a war. They would likely only do so if it was
absolutely and clearly necessary, to defend their
families and country, with an end-goal in site.*

[b] Since there would be no undue profits to be made,
government officials and corporations would not be
incentivized to promote or engage in war as a
viable option.

[b] *Efforts would greatly increase to find ways to
come to peaceful, low-cost resolutions instead.*
