[o] WE NEED [b]BITCOIN

[o]TO REPLACE THE CENTRALLY
CONTROLLED, MANIPULATED, DEBTBASED ECONOMY

r> I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again,
before we take the thing out of the hands of government,
that is, we can’t take them violently out of the hands of
government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way
introduce something they can’t stop.

~ Friedrich Hayek, 1984
 Austrian Economist, Philosopher and Author, 1899-1992
