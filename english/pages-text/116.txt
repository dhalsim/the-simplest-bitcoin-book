H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: SOME PEOPLE HAVE TOO MUCH

[b] It is true that some people have far more than others.
*In releasing the protocol openly, Satoshi allowed it to
roam freely, and those that understood the potential
it held either mined, or bought in early. It was the
fairest and most organic way possible to present it
to the world.*

[b] Over time, when the world is hyperbitcoinized, meaning we are living on a bitcoin standard, those that
have more will naturally spend it into the economy.

[b] Even though at a certain point one will no longer be
able to buy it with fiat, people will get paid for their
work in bitcoin. Being paid in truly sound money will
allow us to have real savings that will not be debased
over time by inflation

[b] While there will always be those with more wealth
and those with less, due to a vast number of factors,
*a bitcoin standard will make the membrane between
wealth classes permeable,* as Aleks Svetsi says. This
will allow both upward and downward mobility to be
far, far more fluid than it is today.

[b]b: Having been born into, and swimming our whole lives
in a fiat world, it is almost impossible to imagine, and
fully grok the implications of having a money that
cannot be debased or manipulated!
