H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:20] A BITCOIN TRANSACTION UNDER
THE HOOD:

(Definitions of the terms that are *in bold* follow)

[obb:

1. When Ali sends those sats to Benji, the payment
*transaction* is *broadcast* to the network.

2. The transaction gets validated by *nodes* that
make sure Ali really has the bitcoin to send, and
that it has not previously been spent (to prevent
double-spending) .

3. Once validated by a node, it waits in the *mempool*
with other peoples' transactions.

4. The transactions in the mempool get added in a
block to the *blockchain* when a *miner* finds a *nonce*
that satisfies the *difficulty algorithm.*

5. Each *block* has a *timestamp.*

6. This creates *immutability*, and helps protect the
difficulty algorithm adjustment from being
manipulated.

7. Each block represents one confirmation for the
transactions included in it.

8. As blocks are added, on average every ten mins,
the immutability of the blockchain increases.
