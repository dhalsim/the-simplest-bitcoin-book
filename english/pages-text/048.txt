H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[b] *Bitcoin is a record keeper that uses mathematics and
computer science, instead of bankers, bookkeepers
and accountants.*

[b] It eliminates the middlemen, banks, govts, overdraft
fees, checking account fees, limited hours of service,
potential for censorship, frozen accounts, manipulation of the money supply, interest rates, the IMF,
the WEF, the BIS, brick-and-mortar buildings, ATMs,
checks, chargebacks, the petro dollar, the euro
dollar, bank seigniorage, the cantillon effect,
fractional reserve banking, visa, mastercard, amex,
western union, days of waiting for your wire transfer
to go through ...

[obb:

[b] *Instead of having someone between you and the
person whose hand you want to shake, you can just
shake their hand directly.*

[b] *No need to ask permission to send your own
money!*
