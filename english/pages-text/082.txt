H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

--o--
[b] *TIMESTAMP ~ Stamps the time*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> Every block mined has a timestamp added to it.
-> This is for added security, immutability and to help
establish the difficulty adjustment

[b] *IMMUTABILITY ~ Cannot be changed.*
--o--

[m-l-20] -> This means the blockchain is ‘set in digital stone’.

--o--
[b] *PROOF-OF-WORK (PoW) ~ Cryptographic proof
that difficult work was done to satisfy an algorithm.*
--o--


[m-l-20] -> Miners use the PoW algorithm to prove they have
used a lot of computational power via electricity
(work), in order to achieve consensus in a decentralized manner, and to prevent corrupt actors
from spamming the network.

--o--
[b] *PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY ~ A process that
creates the digital keys to access your bitcoins.*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> This is a system whereby two keys are created
through a cryptographic algorithm.
-> One key is public - Like your bank account number, that you can give people to send bitcoin to
you for goods, gifts or services.
-> The other key is private - Only you have a copy,
and you use it to unlock access to your bitcoin,
just as a password unlocks your online bank
account.
-> You must secure your private key very well,
since anyone who has access to it has access to
your bitcoin.
