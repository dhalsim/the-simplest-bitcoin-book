-> Nodes are computers that run the bitcoin
software.
-> Nodes, along with miners, users and
developers, form the peer-to-peer Bitcoin
network.
-> Imagine *each full node as a ledger containing the
balances of every private key.*
-> They interact, and reach consensus (agree) with
one another by accepting and validating
transactions from other nodes, along with blocks
from miners, and then relaying these onward to
other nodes.
-> Nodes are run by an ad-hoc group of thousands
of volunteers around the world.
-> A full node is one that has independently
validated the entire Bitcoin blockchain, since the
Genesis Block mined by Satoshi in 2009.
-> The more active nodes there are, the more distributed, and therefore resilient, the whole network
becomes.
-> There are *currently over 19,000 reachable full
nodes worldwide, & far more unreachable ones.*
-> All participating nodes are equal.
