> I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.
Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation,
therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men.
We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most
completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized
world. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a
government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a
government by the opinion and duress of
a small group of dominant men.

~ Woodrow Wilson
28th President of the United States, 1913-1921
6 years after passing the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

> The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know,
that a financial element in the large centers
has owned the government of the U.S. since
the days of Andrew Jackson.

~ Franklin D. Roosevelt
32nd President of the United States in a letter written
on Nov. 21, 1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House

> It [the depression] was not accidental.
It was a carefully contrived occurrenceâ€¦.
The international bankers sought to bring about
a condition of despair here so that they might

> Each and every time a bank makes a loan,
