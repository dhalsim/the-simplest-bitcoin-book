H: What Is [b]bitcoin?

[b] *Bitcoin is the antidote.*

[b] Attempting to ‘stabilize’ the economy with bailouts,
money printing, QE and interest rate manipulation is
like having it on artificial life support

[b] This ‘machine’ can only go on so long, before becoming more and more expensive to maintain, and less
and less sustainable, leading to a serious breakdown.

[b] *Bitcoin fixes this*

[b] *Bitcoin is better money.*
