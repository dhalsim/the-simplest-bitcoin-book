As I submit this 2nd Edition for print, 
I reflect on the process of writing, editing, updating, 
fact-checking and, most importantly, 
adding the new section on Nostr, 
and I am in awe.

In awe of all of you, orange-pilled, purple-pilled 
and yet-to-be, 
all on this journey with me, 
as we march forward, 
resolute in our mission to continue the work 
of the cypherpunks, 
the freedom lovers, the visionaries, 
those who looked ahead, 
who understood both the power and the danger 
of the digital world left unchecked, 

and who sought, and still seek, to 
write the code we all need,
to live into a future of freedom.

It is up to us to use it.

Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.
