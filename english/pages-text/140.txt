H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[r:
  [o:18] A RABBIT HOLE PONDERING

  Bitcoin is really a rather fascinating ‘thing’
  Except it is not a ‘thing’
  In the sense that you cannot touch it
  Yet it is touching millions of us
  Around the world
  Soon to be billions..
  It is true that
  It is digital bits and bytes
  Algorithms and code
  0’s and 1’s
  And that if every single node
  Archival node, pruned node and light node
  Were somehow
  Destroyed
  It would no longer exist
  In the way we know it
  Are able to perceive it..
  It would, however, still ‘exist’
  In the sense that quantum physics
  Or gravity
  Exists
  Regardless of human perception..
  In the sense that mathematics existed
  Before humans codified it
  Chose symbols to represent it..
  Truth
  Does not need us
