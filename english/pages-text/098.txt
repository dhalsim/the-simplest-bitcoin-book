[o:20]r: EO 6102

[b] In 1933 *President Roosevelt issued Executive Order
6102, which required every US citizen to turn in
most of their gold in exchange for bank notes.*

[b] The gold was valued at $20.67/oz. The following
year, the government increased the price of gold to
$35/oz with the Gold Reserve Act of 1934,
effectively devaluing the notes people had
received by almost half, since the value of their
notes never went up with the inflated gold price.
