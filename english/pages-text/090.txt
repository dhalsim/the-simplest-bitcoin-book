H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:20] BENEFITS OF ⚡️:

[b] VOLUME - The volume of transactions per second is
in essence limitless, as countless channels can be
opened at the same time, each keeping their own
‘tab’.

[b] MICROPAYMENTS - You can send as little as 1
satoshi (currently $0.0006).

[b] SPEED - It usually takes between a millisecond and a
few seconds to receive a payment.

[b] PRIVACY - Transactions are not stored on the open,
public bitcoin blockchain. In some ways it is even
more private than cash, because with Lightning,
even the other party does not necessarily know who
you are, as your payment often ‘hops’ through
different channels to reach the receiver.

To be clear, I am not saying it is 100% impossible to
uncover, just far more so than with payments on the
bitcoin mainchain.
It would take an immense amount of time and energy
to establish with certainty who was making payments
to whom, and it would not always be possible to
do so at all.
