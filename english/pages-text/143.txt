H: [b]bitcoin Induced Ponderings

[o:18]r: BITCOIN,
  NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATION
  & PERMACULTURE

I see *Bitcoin*, brought to us by Satoshi Nakamoto, as being
the foundation layer for a healthy society with regards to:

[b]b: communicating value
[b]b: transacting and exchanging
[b]b: storing our time/life energy
      in an emergent, organic, honest unfolding.

I see *Nonviolent Communication*, brought to us by Marshall
Rosenberg PhD, as the foundation layer for a healthy society
with regards to:

[b]b: communicating feelings and needs
[b]b: deep listening, empathy
[b]b: finding co-creative solutions
      in an emergent, organic, honest unfolding.

I see *Natural Farming and Permaculture*, brought to us by
our Ancestors, and more recently, Masunobu Fukuoka and Bill
Mollison as being the foundation layer for a healthy society
with regards to:

[b]b: communication with the earth
[b]b: growing food, healing the soil
[b]b: tending the wild
      in an emergent, organic and honest unfolding.
