    The [b]bitcoin
    White Paper

  Presented to the world on metzdowd.com
  2008-10-31

  [fs-18] *by Satoshi Nakamoto*

  A pseudonymous cypherpunk, who last communicated
    with the cypherpunk community on the bitcointalk.org
    forum on 2010-12-10.

  By leaving, he allowed Bitcoin to be a true experiment in
  the wild. Everyone who works on it is a volunteer in some
  sense <-> inspired by the potential of freeing humanity
  from the shackles of a manipulated, debt-based money
  system, and instead, participating in a global, trustless,
  permissionless, censorship-resistant, truly scarce, peer-to
  peer, decentralized money and monetary payment network, that is inspiring an emergent order to rise out of the
  fiat ashes

  *We are all Satoshi*
