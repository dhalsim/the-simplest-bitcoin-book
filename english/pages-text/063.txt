H: What Is [b]Bitcoin?

[b] *Bitcoin is the solution to the double-spend problem.*

[b] This means that when you send bitcoin, the receiver
can be sure that you actually owned the bitcoin you
sent, and, that once you sent it to them you cannot
spend those coins again by sending them to someone
else (double-spending).

[b] Just like me giving you an orange. Once it leaves
my hands and is in your hands, I no longer have
the orange to give to someone else.

rmi> ..double-spends are never accepted into the
transaction pool, so every node bears
witness to which transaction it saw first
by working to put it into a block.
