H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: YOU CAN’T TOUCH A BITCOIN

[b] *This is a feature, not a bug.* The very fact that bitcoin
is not physical is one of the biggest factors contributing to it’s unconfiscatability!

[o:18]r: BITCOIN COULD GET HACKED

[b] In the 15 years since it was launched, it has never
been hacked.

[b] There have been hacks at exchanges however, so I
highly recommend moving your bitcoin to your own
self-custody wallet as soon as possible.

[b] It has been estimated that to break the SHA-256
encryption (that bitcoin uses) within 24 hours, a
quantum computer would need 13,000,000 physical
qubits. At this time, the current qubit record held
by Atom Computing in California is 1,180 qubits.

[b] It is widely assumed that a quantum-safe encryption
method will be developed well before it is needed.

rmi> Being open source means anyone can
independently review the code. If it was
closed source, nobody could verify the
security. I think it’s essential for a
program of this nature to be open source.
