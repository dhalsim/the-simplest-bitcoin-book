H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

rmi> We define an electronic coin as a chain of
digital signatures. Each owner transfers
the coin to the next by digitally signing
a hash of the previous transaction and the
public key of the next owner and adding
these to the end of the coin. A payee can
verify the signatures to verify the chain
of ownership.
