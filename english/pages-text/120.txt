H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: ON THE PRICE OF BITCOIN

[b]b: I see hodling (holding) bitcoin like having a long-term
savings account.

[b] The daily price doesn’t matter, as it is expected to be
volatile (go up and down) for some years yet.

[b] As I mentioned previously, this is normal for a new
asset undergoing price discovery.

[b] If one zooms out on the BTC/USD price chart, you
will see that it has increased by +31,296% since 2009,
averaged out to ~200% per year.

[b] The price swings reflect various news articles, regulatory updates, market demand, fear and excitement. It’s a roller-coaster!

[b]b: The longer you hodl, the more you learn and understand the fundamentals, and the more you realize the profound implications of having sound money,
the less the price matters.

[obb][b]b: In the end, ‘price’ won’t matter at all, as bitcoin
will be the unit of account.

[b] *Disclaimer:*

[m-l-20:
  -> Only put in what you ‘can afford to lose’, since
  there are, of course, no guarantees.
  -> Consider the bitcoin you buy as a long-term
  savings account, and plan to leave it in cold
  storage for a minimum of five years before
  spending.
