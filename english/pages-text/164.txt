H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[O] You can create a human-readable username using
NIP-05. *For example:*

[O] *My Public Key, or npub is:*
npub1dpna3xwwddnhhzg9ycpvlcz2ze0jdwm2rf3eqd2lf9leaewtq7tqhw0ef2

[O] *My NIP-05 Nostr address is:*
SimplestBitcoinBook@nostrplebs.com

[O] *You can search for people on nostr* by entering their:
[
  -> npub
  -> NIP-05 (aka nostr address) if they have one
]

[O] *Get a NIP-05 Identifier here:*
[
  -> nostrplebs.com
  -> verified-nostr.com
  -> getalby.com
  -> Or set one up with your own domain
]

[O] Once you have your nostr key pair, you can log into any
nostr client with those same keys, and you will see that
you *retain your identity and followers/following lists*
on all the clients.

[O] This differs from legacy social media, where you need a
separate account, username and password for each
platform, and you have different content, follows and
followers on each one. 

ri> At it's most basic level, Nostr is a communication
protocol that acts as the social glue that binds
all of your apps together.
