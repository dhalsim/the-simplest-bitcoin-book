H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: BITCOIN IS USED BY CRIMINALS

[b] *So is the dollar, and every other fiat currency in the
world.* It is simply incorrect to attribute this
problem only to bitcoin.

[b]b: Bitcoin is a tool, just like a knife, and it is up to each
one of us how we use it.

[b] Interestingly, if bitcoin couldn't be used by criminals,
then it would not be the neutral, censorship-resistant
money the world so badly needs.

[b] *Note:* Since the Bitcoin blockchain is auditable, it is
actually a really bad choice for criminal activity!

[o:18]r: QUANTUM COMPUTING COULD
BREAK BITCOIN

[b] While this may be a possibility one day in the future,
*developers are already working on solutions for postquantum encryption.*

[b] Bitcoin is only one of a multitude of online applications that rely on SHA-256 hashing for security.

[b] Even the military uses it, so there is massive incentive beyond the bitcoin community to develop new
encryption protocols.

[b] If SHA-256 is broken, we will have a lot else to
worry about beyond bitcoin. The entire internet uses
it for encryption. This includes all banking, supply
chains, transportation systems, healthcare systems,
education systems and more.
