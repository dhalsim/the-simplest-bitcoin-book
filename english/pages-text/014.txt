[o] CYCLES

[b] *In all of nature, there are cycles, natural ebbs and
flows, expansions and contractions.*

[b] This *contributes to an overall, over-time, balance
and sustainability* of the whole interconnected
system, of all life on earth.

[b] *The debt-based, fiat currency system ignores the
wisdom of natural cycles,* and instead is based on,
and 100% reliant for its survival upon, unparalleled
and unmitigated growth, in order to continue
servicing its debts.

[b] In nature, this is cancer.

[b] In ‘the economy’, this unnatural trajectory is further
supported by the government bailing out failing
banks and large companies, rather than allowing them
to fold, and be recycled into something new, something healthier.

[b] *The short-sightedness of bailing out failing companies is putting the whole economy at risk.* In essence,
it is just kicking the can down the road, and the inevitable turmoil that lies ahead is likely to be far, far
more intense than if natural cycles were allowed to
play out.

[b] *We are indebted to Satoshi Nakamoto, and to the
cypherpunks before and after him,* for having the
vision, foresight, determination and skill to provide
a lifeboat to carry us to new shores.
