FROM THE HORSEâ€™S MOUTH OF OLDE

> The bank hath benefit of interest on all monies that it creates out of nothing.

~ William Paterson, 
1694  Founder of the Bank of England

> All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from the want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.

~ John Adams 
2nd President of the United States, 1797-1801

> I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power should be taken from the banks, and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

~ Thomas Jefferson 
3rd President of the United States, 1801-1809

> While boasting of our noble deeds were careful to conceal the ugly fact that by an iniquitous money system we have nationalized a system of oppression which, though more refined, is not less cruel than the old system of chattel slavery.

~ Horace Greeley 
US Congressman 1848-49
Founder of The New York Tribune
