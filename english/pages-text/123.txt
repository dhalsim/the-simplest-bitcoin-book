Of the over 2.5 million* (!) cryptocurrencies ever created,
and 13,000 currently trading, bitcoin is the *only one* that is:

[b]b: TRULY decentralized
[b] With a *TRULY distributed ledger*
[b] A *TRULY hard capped supply*
[b] A *TRULY immutable ledger*
[b] A *network effect* built over 15 years
[b] And a *monetary policy that cannot be manipulated!*
[b] Every other cryptocurrency has a *small, centralized
group who controls the supply, and/or has the
power to change the base layer protocol (monetary
policy).*
[b]b: This is just like the central fiat banking system we
see today.
[b] Centralized power like this begs for manipulation and
corruption.
