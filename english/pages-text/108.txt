[o:20]r: BITCOIN USES TOO MUCH ENERGY

rmi> The heat from your computer is not wasted
if you need to heat your home… It’s
equal cost if you generate the heat
with your computer.

~ Satoshi Nakamoto 2010-08-09

ri> At first, the production of a commodity simply because it
is costly seems quite wasteful. However, the unforgeably
costly commodity repeatedly adds value by enabling
beneficial wealth transfers. More of the cost is recouped
every time a transaction is made possible or made
less expensive. The cost, initially a complete waste, is
amortized over many transactions.
