H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[b] *Bitcoin is anti-fragile.*

[b] And it gets more so with every attempted attack,
with every government ban, with every piece of mainstream media FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).

[obb:c] [b] Bitcoin has never been hacked.*

[b] Though many have tried.

[m-l-25:

* Although you may have heard of hacks, it is
the exchanges that have been hacked, not
the bitcoin protocol.

[b] *Remember:*

-> Not your keys, not your coins.
-> Always withdraw your sats to your own wallet.
-> Best to buy peer-to-peer.
