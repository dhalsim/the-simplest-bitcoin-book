> Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is
absolute master of all industry and commerce…
when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one
way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have
to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.

~ James A. Garfield
20th President of the United States, Mar-Sept.1881
Assassinated in 1881

> There today exists uncontrolled in the hands of a set of men
a power to make dollars from nothing.

~ Thomas W. Lawson, Author 'Frenzied Finance', 1905

> I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator.
Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time
and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our
particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that
bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.

~ Frank A.Vanderlip
President of the National City Bank of New York
(forerunner of Citi Bank)

> Writing in 1935 of the secretive meeting that took place on
Jekyll Island in 1910, to draft the bill that was passed as
the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.
This (Federal Reserve) Act establishes the most gigantic trust on
earth. When the President (Woodrow Wilson) signs the Bill, the
invisible government of the Monetary Power will be legalised…
The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated
by this banking and currency Bill.

~ Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr.
US Congressman 1907-1917
