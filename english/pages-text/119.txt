ri> Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital
asset. No other digital asset is likely to improve upon
bitcoin as a monetary good because bitcoin is the most
(relative to other digital assets) secure, decentralized,
sound digital money and any “improvement”
will necessarily face tradeoffs.
