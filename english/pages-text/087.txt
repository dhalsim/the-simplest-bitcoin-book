rmi> In a few decades when the reward gets too
small, the transaction fee will become the
main compensation for nodes (miners).

[obb] [b] *Miners will always be needed to verify transactions,
thereby keeping the network updated and secure.*

[b] While one needs to be aware that there are costs
involved, and profitability is negligible for home
miners, it is a powerful way to help secure and keep
the network decentralized.

[b] Miners last quite a few years. There are currently many
Antminer S9â€™s for example, that have been running
for over 6 years.

[b] When miners are retired *they can easily be taken
apart and recycled.*

[b] *Tons of fascinating innovation is happening,* with
people using the excess heat from miners to
heat their homes, saunas, greenhouses, hot tubs,
dry jerky and vegetables, heat decks, dry wood and
more!
