H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o] BITCOIN BLOCK REWARD = Subsidy + Fees

[obb:b:

[b] For their work, miners get:

  [m-l-20:

  -> A subsidy, in the form of freshly minted bitcoins.
  -> Plus, the fees from the verified transactions
  included in that block.

  ]
]

[b] *When you send bitcoin to someone, that transaction
includes a fee* and needs to be verified by a miner,
and then included in a block.

[b] The *bitcoin block subsidy* gets cut in half every four
years.

[b] It is *currently 3.125 bitcoin* per block that is mined.

[b] *The next ‘halving’ will be in 2028,* at which point
the block reward will drop to 1.5625 bitcoin per
block mined.

[b] As mentioned before, *this keeps the issuance stable.*

[b] *In the year 2140, the last piece of bitcoin will be
mined.*

[b] After that, miners will only get the fees from the transactions they verify in each block.
