H: How Does [b]Bitcoin Work?

--o--
[b] *PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) NETWORK ~ A decentralized
network with no middlemen
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> Full nodes (peers) collaboratively maintain a peerto-peer network for transaction and block validation and verification.
-> In this type of network, each node is able to
both provide/request data to/from its peers.
-> There are no gatekeepers in a P2P network.

--o--
[b] *LIGHTNING NETWORK ~ A network built on bitcoin that makes it possible to send or receive
sats very fast and almost for free.*
--o--

[m-l-20] -> Lightning is a Layer 2 scaling solution. This means
it provides a way for bitcoin to scale, giving it the
potential to process millions of transactions per
second (TPS).

--o--
[b] *WALLET ~ A ‘wallet’ holds the cryptographic
keys to access your bitcoin.*
--o--

[m-l-20:

-> It can be on a phone, computer or on a separate
small hardware device (the safest).
-> A bitcoin wallet would more accurately be called a
signing device. Your bitcoin never actually leaves
the blockchain, the digital ledger.
-> When you wish to send or spend your bitcoin, the
wallet will sign and broadcast the transaction to
the network, so that it can be validated and
added into a block on the blockchain.

--o--
[b] *DEVELOPERS ~ Computer programmers*
--o--

[m-l-20] -> Cypherpunks/programmers that maintain the network, improve security, check for bugs, submit
pull requests (for new updates or features), review
pull requests, audit the code.
