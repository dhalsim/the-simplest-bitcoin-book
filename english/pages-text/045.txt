H: What Is [b]bitcoin?

[b] *Bitcoin is historical.* This is the first time in history that
a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant, immutable,
borderless, permissionless, and incorruptible monetary system with an absolute hard cap (21 million
coins) has ever been created.

[obb][b] Bitcoin is *as significant to decentralizing power
and increasing financial inclusion,* as the invention
of the printing press, and later the World Wide
Web, *was to decentralizing control of, and
increasing access to, information.*

rim> A lot of people automatically
dismiss e-currency as a lost cause
because of all the companies that failed
since the 1990’s.
I hope it’s obvious it was only the
centrally controlled nature of those
systems that doomed them.
I think this is the first time we’re trying
a decentralized, non-trust-based system.
