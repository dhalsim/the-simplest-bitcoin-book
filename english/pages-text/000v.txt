I love the simple life, 
I love nature, I love being barefoot, 
I love profound conversation that sparks creativity, 
connection and inspiration. 
I love freedom. 

And, I love bitcoin. 

Love is a big word, bitcoin is worthy of big love. 

Itâ€™s existence is a point of bright light in this most 
challenged time in human existence. 

I wrote this book in the hopes of making bitcoin, and the 
reasons we need it, more accessible to more seekers. 

This book is a starting point, into what I, and many others, 
have discovered is a phenomenally endless, life-changing 
and beautiful rabbit hole! 

May you be orange-pilled, may you be free, 
and may you be well enriched by the journey!
