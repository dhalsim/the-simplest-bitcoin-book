H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[b] *Bitcoin is the solution to the Byzantine General’s
problem.*

[b] This was once thought to be an unsolvable problem in
computer science.

[b] This problem arises in decentralized systems, where
it was thought impossible to prove that message sent
= message received, since the ‘man-in-the-middle’
could be a bad actor and falsify the message.

[b] In other words, it seemed impossible to form consensus amongst a network of distributed and independent computers.

[b] By using a timestamp along with a cryptographically secured distributed ledger, Satoshi solved this
problem.

[b] His solution is known as *Nakamoto’s consensus.*
