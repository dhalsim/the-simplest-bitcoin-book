H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: SECURITY & AVOIDING SCAMS

[b]b: Stick with bitcoin only.

[b] *Be super vigilant* about your cyber security!

[b] *Do your own research and secure your bitcoin* with
utmost care.

[obb][b]b: NEVER give your seed words to anyone you
wouldn’t give the key to for your stash of gold!

[b] *NEVER click on any links* in your email that ask you
to confirm account details of any kind. *Instead, go
to the official website directly* and check if you have
any notices requiring any actions.

[b] *BE AWARE* that there are endless imitations of
accounts with large followings on social media. If an
influencer randomly DMs you, it is probably a scam.

[b] *AVOID all the scams popping up on social media*
accounts, promising to double your bitcoin if you
send some to them! You will lose your bitcoin!

[b] *AVOID those same ‘double your crypto’ scams* on
You Tube.

[b] *BE CERTAIN* about the address you are sending your
bitcoin to, as transactions are irreversible. Ideally
check the whole address, especially if it is a large
amount.
