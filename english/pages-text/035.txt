[o:20] TIME PREFERENCE

*High Time Preference:* Instant gratification, Impatience,
 Short-term planning
*Low Time Preference:* Delayed gratification, Patience,
 Long-term planning

[b] High-time preference leads to personal, societal and
environmental destruction. When our money is
losing value each day, we are ‘forced’ to be
impatient and to spend it as quickly as possible,
before it loses more value. 

[b] When our time is devalued by an ever-inflating fiat
currency, we lose connection to the value of our
time.

[b] This leads to disconnection, and an undercurrent
of stress.

[b] Attempts to alleviate the stress, and find meaning,
are distorted and become distractions such as
over-consumption of drugs, alcohol, shopping,
porn, fast food, short attention spans, addiction
to screens/social media, impulsive decisions etc.

[b] *Sound money on the other hand, which holds its
value over time and properly measures our
contributions through our work, leads to a lowtime preference, thoughtful quality of life, with
meaningful relationships, less consumption, deeper
connection, more profound conversation, long-term
goals and increased creativity.*
