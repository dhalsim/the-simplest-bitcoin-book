[o] A NOTE ON THE PETRO DOLLAR

[b] One could say *that until 1971 the dollar was backed
by gold, and since 1974 it has been backed by oil,
and thus by default, the US Military.*

[b] *In 1974 the US and Saudi Arabia entered into bilateral agreements to price the sale of oil in US dollars.*

[b] Since then, most global oil sales have been settled in
US dollars.

[b] This has contributed greatly to the dollar becoming
the strongest currency in the world.

[b] It has thus been artificially propped up, even during
times when it would normally have struggled.

[b] Since late in 2022, a number of countries have
begun to trade in currencies other than the US
dollar.

[b] It is very possible that this could be the beginning of
the end of the petro dollar. What happens next
remains to be seenâ€¦
