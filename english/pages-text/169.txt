[p:18]r: JOIN US

[O] Nostr is still very young. Just like bitcoin, but much
younger, it is a grassroots, messy, global, ground-up
experiment.

[O] If you see the value in a decentralized, censorshipresistant, open-source communications protocol,
please join us in using it, developing it, offering
feedback to the devs, and participating in whatever
way you feel called, to help grow this free speech tool.

[O] It is an amazing experience to engage in a growing
technology that is built to preserve freedom of speech
and open communication globally.

[O] Dive in and learn along with the rest of us sovereign
souls, embracing the inherent chaos to create beauty,
and to forge a bright future for our grandchildren!

[ri:
  More important than all is that we must keep in mind that
  nostr is just a very loose set of servers with basically no
  connection between them, ... and the process of keeping
  connected to others and finding content must be
  addressed through many different hackish attempts. To
  write Nostr applications and to use Nostr one
  must embrace the inherent chaos.
