H: The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written

[o:18]r: GOVERNMENTS COULD BAN BITCOIN

[b] Some governments have tried, like China, India and
Nigeria for example. In each case, the use of bitcoin
rises rapidly by the people of said country.

[b] *There is no way for governments to truly ‘ban’ bitcoin,* as it is by its nature permissionless and censorship-resistant. It is code and code is speech.

[b] That said, governments can make it harder to buy
and sell with, and into fiat. They can also tax it as a
commodity, like they do in the US.

[b] *Ultimately, it will not be in their favor to try and ban
it, since bitcoin is inevitable and they are starting
to see that.* They would be far smarter to add it to
their country’s balance sheet as a hedge against their
inflating fiat currencies.

rmi> Governments are good at cutting off the
heads of centrally controlled networks
like Napster, but pure P2P networks
like Gnutella and Tor seem to be
holding their own.

~ Satoshi Nakamoto
