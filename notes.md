## About book title

"The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written" is translated as "Şimdiye Kadar Yazılmış En Basit Bitcoin Kitabı" which is very long. Alternatively it can be "Yazılmış En Basit Bitcoin Kitabı"

"The Simplest Bitcoin Book" can be translated as "En Basit Bitcoin Kitabı" which is shorter but sounds a bit awkward.

I'm thinking of complete different title for the book such as "Bitcoin'in Felsefesi" which means "The Philosophy of Bitcoin", which I think is both shorter and can be interesting for the Turkish audience.

As more miners join the network, the target number (nonce) in
the lottery decreases, making it harder to find a winning
number.

As far as I understand, the nonce is the number that miners need to find to solve the puzzle. The target number is the difficulty of the puzzle. Nonce is completely random and has nothing to do with the difficulty.

So I fixed it like this:

As more miners join the network, the target number in
the lottery decreases (difficulty increases), making it harder to find a winning
number.
