## About book title

"The Simplest Bitcoin Book Ever Written" is translated as "Şimdiye Kadar Yazılmış En Basit Bitcoin Kitabı" which is very long. Alternatively it can be "Yazılmış En Basit Bitcoin Kitabı"

"The Simplest Bitcoin Book" can be translated as "En Basit Bitcoin Kitabı" which is shorter but sounds a bit awkward.

I'm thinking of complete different title for the book such as "Bitcoin'in Felsefesi" which means "The Philosophy of Bitcoin", which I think is both shorter and can be interesting for the Turkish audience.
